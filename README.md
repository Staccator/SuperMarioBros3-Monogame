# SuperMarioBros3-Monogame
A recreation of original Super Mario Bros 3 made in Monogame, working almost identically as original. I've made a few minor changes, and obviously I wasn't able to make all levels. 

In order to play simply download all files, load "SuperMarioBros.sln" into Visual Studio and run.
